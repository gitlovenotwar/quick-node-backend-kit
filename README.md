```


### Usage:
- lone the repository
- Extend / Add more dependencies for suitable needs
- Run `npm install`
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and other necessary variables needed
- Run at least once `npm run build` to have the `dist` folder created for server to have the client source compiled and be served


### Commands:
- `npm run server` - open terminal and run it on root project to start the server
- `npm run start` - open another terminal and run it on root project as well to start the development on client 
- `npm run build` - to compile client assets to be deployed, it will create `dist` folder on server
- `npm run test` - to execute and run test with jest / enzyme
